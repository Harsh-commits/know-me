              <h1>Cheetah</h1>
              The cheetah is a unique felid, with its closest living relatives
              being the puma and jaguarundi of the Americas. The cheetah
              (Acinonyx jubatus) is a small cat in the subfamily Felinae that
              inhabits most of Africa and parts of Iran. It is the only extant
              member of the genus Acinonyx. The cheetah can run as fast as 109.4
              to 120.7 km/h (68.0 to 75.0 mph), faster than any other land
              animal. It covers distances up to 500 m (1,640 ft) in short
              bursts, and can accelerate from 0 to 96 km/h (0 to 60 mph) in
              three seconds.
